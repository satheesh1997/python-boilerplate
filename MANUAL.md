Hello Geek,
    Thanks for choosing python3.8.2-boilerplate to start your project.
This boilerplate code comes with Python 3.8.2 & oytest. The project
structure is slightly modified in this boilerplate to make it slightly
comfortale for the developer to build their ideas on top of this.

DIR STRUCTURE:
    - src (can be changed to package name)
    - tests (all the tests goes here)
    - setup.py (python script to build & install the project)

TESTS:
    Pytest is added to the requirements and is attached to the
boilerplate code. You can write and run your tests using nose.

VERSION: 0.0.1

More updates will come in the next versions.


STAY TUNED
